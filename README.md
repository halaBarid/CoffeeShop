# CoffeeShop

The Coffee Shop project is a web-based platform designed to promote and showcase a coffee shop. It provides information and features that help customers explore the coffee shop's offerings and learn more about its team, culture, and menu. This project was meticulously crafted using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, showcasing the capabilities of these fundamental web technologies in creating an engaging and visually appealing online presence for a coffee shop.
